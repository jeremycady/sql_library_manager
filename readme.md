# SQL Library Manager

This application uses Express to connect a user to a library database.

The user has the ability to add, update, and delete books.

A fetch API connects with the Google Books API to allow users to more easily add their books.

The Sequelize ORM is used to make all the connections and queries to the SQLite database.

Pagination and Search, handled server-side, were added to make finding and traversing the data easy.
